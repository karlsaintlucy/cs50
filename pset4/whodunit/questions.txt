1. What’s stdint.h?
stdint.h is a header file that allows fixed-width integer types to be used across different systems, making programs more portable.

2. What’s the point of using uint8_t, uint32_t, int32_t, and uint16_t in a program?
In this case, using these types along with typedef, we can create aliases of them that correspond to Microsoft's proprietary data
structures used in bitmap files. Consequently, we can build structs in C that map each relevant portion of the bitmap onto data
types we recognize.

3. How many bytes is a BYTE, a DWORD, a LONG, and a WORD, respectively?
A BYTE has 1 byte (8 bits); a DWORD has 4 bytes (32 bits); a LONG has 4 bytes (32 bits); and a WORD has 2 bytes (16 bits).

4. What (in ASCII, decimal, or hexadecimal) must the first two bytes of any BMP file be? Leading bytes used to identify file formats
(with high probability) are generally called "magic numbers."
In ASCII, "BM"; in decimal, 66 77; in hexadecimal, 0x42 0x4d (or 424d).

5. What’s the difference between bfSize and biSize?
bfSize contains the size (in bytes) of the bitmap file; biSize containes the size (in bytes) of the BITMAPINFOHEADER (always decimal
40 or 0x28).

6. What does it mean if biHeight is negative?
It means the bitmap starts from the upper-left corner and moves downward.

7. What field in BITMAPINFOHEADER specifies the BMP’s color depth (i.e., bits per pixel)?
The biBitCount field specifies the number of bits per pixel.

8. Why might fopen return NULL in lines 24 and 32 of copy.c?
fopen() might return NULL if the system has not given read or write permissions for the corresponding files.

9. Why is the third argument to fread always 1 in our code?
Because if we're reading a chunk of code that's specified to be as large as its corresponding header, we're going to eat it all in
one gulp.

10. What value does line 65 of copy.c assign to padding if bi.biWidth is 3?
padding =
(4 - (bi.biWidth * sizeof(RGBTRIPLE)) % 4) % 4;
(4 - (3 * 3) % 4) % 4;
(4 - 9 % 4) % 4;
(4 - 1) % 4;
3 % 4;
3

11. What does fseek do?
It changes file position by the offset amount held by padding, from the current file position in the file pointer performing
read functions (inptr).

12. What is SEEK_CUR?
SEEK_CUR is an integer constant that denotes the current position within the file.
